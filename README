the installation instructions located in the INSTALL file.

GUI Versions of LifeLines for Windows and UNIX/GNOME are under
development.  Visit the LifeLines home page
(see top of file for URL) for details on how to obtain pre-compiled
or beta (test) copies of these versions.

The DOS text mode version has been integrated into the primary
